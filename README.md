# Radix-Sort

In my version of least significant digit radix sort, weâ€™re going to utilize the string representation of each integer. This, combined with negative indexing, will allow us to count each digit in a number from right-to-left.

Some other implementations utilize integer division and modular arithmetic to find each digit in a radix sort
